// htmx and Alpine are bundled from npm (see package.json) and exposed as globals
// in app.ts for parity with the old CDN builds. These declarations give the
// editor the official types for both the bare globals (used by ./lib modules)
// and the window.* assignments. `import type` is erased before esbuild bundles.
